# Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Visual Reasoning via Dynamic Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs)

## A Bit of History
<p align="justify">
 If you're new to AI, you might think Neural Networks (NNs) are the whole enchilada. You might even believe AI and NNs are practically the same thing. Well, you're almost right! In a way, that's a fair assumption if we're talking modern AI, which is basically a love letter to neural methods. Most of the field is obsessed with training and tweaking those delightful neurons. But hold onâ€”AI's history spins a different yarn. Once upon a time, AI was all about logical methods, fondly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI">Good-Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI)</a>. And, my goodness, those methods worked like a charm! For instance, they powered expert systems that could reason through problems with the precision of a mathematician solving a crossword puzzle.

 However, these days, we don't hear about this GOFAI. What did happen? Did we abandon that? Yeah we did! Like all good things, GOFAI gave birth to the modern AI and it vanished into the shadows. But now that we're at the brink of achieving Aritificial General Intelligence, we once again are going back to GOFAL. After all, "cracking gate hangs longest".
