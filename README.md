# Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Visual Reasoning via Dynamic Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs)

## A Bit of History
<p align="justify">
 If you're new to Artificial Intelligence (AI), you might think Neural Networks (NNs) are the whole enchilada. You might even believe AI and NNs are practically the same thing. Well, you're almost right! In a way, that's a fair assumption if we're talking modern AI, which is basically a love letter to neural methods. Most of the field is obsessed with training and tweaking those glorious neurons. But hold on; the history of AI tells a bit different story. Once upon a time, AI was all about logical rules, fondly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI">Good-Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI)</a>. And, my goodness, those methods worked like a charm! For instance, they powered expert systems that could reason through problems with the precision of a mathematician solving a crossword puzzle.

 However, these days, GOFAI is like that retro band you loved in the '90s; rarely heard but fondly remembered. So, what happened? Did we ditch it? You bet we did! Like all good things, GOFAI birthed modern AI and then slipped into the shadows. Why? Well, neural networks swooped in with their data-crunching superpowers, learning everything from cat pics to quantum physics without needing hand-crafted rules. They were flashy, flexible, and frankly, too cool to resist. Also, GOFAI's rigid logic couldn't keep up with the big data party, so it took a backseat. But now, as we teeter on the edge of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we're dusting off GOFAI's playbook. Those logical roots are making a comeback, because, let's face it, learning is great, but reasoning like a human is the real jackpot. After all, as the old saying goes, "the creaking gate hangs longest." So, buckle up', as this is where Neuro-Symbolic AI steal the show!
