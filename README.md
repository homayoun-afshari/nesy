# Neuro-Symbolic Artificial Intelligence for Visual Reasoning via Dynamic Logic Tensor Networks

## A Bit of History

<p align="justify">
 If you're new to Artificial Intelligence (AI), you might think Neural Networks (NNs) are the whole enchilada. You might even believe AI and NNs are practically the same thing. Well, you're almost right! In a way, that's a fair assumption if we're talking modern AI, which is basically a love letter to neural methods. Most of the field is obsessed with training and tweaking those glorious neurons. But hold on; the history of AI tells a bit different story. Once upon a time, AI was all about logical rules, fondly known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI">Good-Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI)</a>. And, my goodness, those methods worked like a charm! For instance, they powered expert systems that could reason through problems with the precision of a mathematician solving a crossword puzzle.

 However, these days, GOFAI is like that retro band you loved in the '90s; rarely heard but fondly remembered. So, what happened? Did we ditch it? You bet we did! Like all good things, GOFAI birthed modern AI and then slipped into the shadows. Why? Well, neural networks swooped in with their data-crunching superpowers, learning everything from cat pics to quantum physics without needing hand-crafted rules. They were flashy, flexible, and frankly, too cool to resist. Also, GOFAI's rigid logic couldn't keep up with the big data party, so it took a backseat. But now, as we teeter on the edge of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we're dusting off GOFAI's playbook. Those logical roots are making a comeback, because, let's face it, learning is great, but reasoning like a human is the real jackpot. After all, as the old saying goes, "the creaking gate hangs longest." So, buckle up for a new brand of AI.

## NeSy AI

<p align="justify">
 How did we revive GOFAI? Enter Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI, the lovechild of NNs and symbolic reasoning, ready to party like it’s 2099. You already know NNs, so let's talk about the other half. Symbolic reasoning is the art of thinking with symbols, like a brainy game of chess where each piece stands for something meaningful, like "cat", "danger", or "pizza". A symbol, in this context, is a tidy little package of meaning, which could be a word, number, or concept that represents something in the real world. For example, picture a robot spotting a furry creature and reasoning: “Furry + meows = probably a cat, not a toaster.” That's symbolic reasoning at work, using clear-cut rules to make sense of the world.

 NeSy AI marries this logical wizardry with a NN's knack for spotting patterns in messy data, like recognizing a cat in a blurry photo, which means giving your NN a PhD in logic while keeping its data-crunching vibes. Cool, right? It becomes even cooler to know this combo works for a good reason. Cognitive science tells us our brains use two systems for thinking. System 1, the Homer Simpson of AI, is your gut instinc; quick, intuitive, and great at spotting patterns in data to apply to new situations. System 2, the Sherlock Holmes of AI, is your beautiful problem-solving mind; deep, deliberate, and powerful at reasoning through data like a sharp knife trhough butter. NeSy does both: its neural part learns from data (System 1) and its symbolic part reasons about it (System 2). But, how do we actually do NeSy AI? We'll dive into that rabbit hole next.
